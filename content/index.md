A/Prof Rochus Hinkel and Dr Stanislav Roudavski, from the research hub ADD+F, together with Prof Dan Hill, have been awarded $25,000 from FB Ideas, a State Government Initiative, and $40,000 from Creative Futures Funds for the development of a more-than-human urban design strategy, the design of prototypes of more-than-human habitats as kit of parts, for Fishermans Bend – Australia’s largest urban renewal project.

The funding will predominantly support the design and construction of more-than-human habitat and the data collection and analysis undertaken by students as part of their education at MSD. In  Sem 2, 2024 students have the unique opportunity to gain real-world experience and design more-than-human habitats. This learning experience is based on the collaboration of the two design-make electives SI_Lab ABPL90422, lead by Tony Yu from the NExT Lab in the Maker Spaces, and DF_Lab ABPL90378, lead by Michael Park from the Fab Lab in the Maker Spaces. Once the teaching period is over students will be fully funded and supported by the Maker Spaces and additional staff to fabricated and installed their design in a location at Fishermans Bend, Australia’s largest urban renewal project.
