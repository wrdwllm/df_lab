#### Framework Goals



### Urban Ecology Study

Urban ecology refers to the "interplay between people, nature, and the environment in urbanised areas." 

The study provides design guidelines to achieve four key areas of the [[#Framework Goals|Framework goals]]:

- Urban forest
- Urban heat
- Wind
- Biodiversity

> In biodiversity priority corridors the following should be maximised in corridors and adjacent private space: vegetation structure diversity (tall grasses, shrubs, short and tall trees), potential incompatible uses, and contiguous medians. 

> Biodiversity Sensitive Urban Design principles should be applied to ensure resources
are provided for diverse animal species, including shelter (e.g. dense, protective shrubs), food (e.g. flowers, fruits, seeds, pollen, nectar) and nesting sites/shelter (e.g. tree cavities), and water
